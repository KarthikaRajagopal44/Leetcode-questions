# You are given an integer array nums consisting of n elements, and an integer k.

# Find a contiguous subarray whose length is equal to k that has the maximum average value and return this value. Any answer with a calculation error less than 10-5 will be accepted.
# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,12,-5,-6,50,3], k = 4
# Output: 12.75000
# Explanation: Maximum average is (12 - 5 - 6 + 50) / 4 = 51 / 4 = 12.75

from typing import List


class Solution:
    def findMaxAverage(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> float:
        
        # Initialize currSum and maxSum to the sum of the initial k elements
        currSum = maxSum = sum(nums[:k])

        # Start the loop from the kth element 
        # Iterate until you reach the end
        for i in range(k, len(nums)):

            # Subtract the left element of the window
            # Add the right element of the window
            currSum += nums[i] - nums[i - k]
            
            # Update the max
            maxSum = max(maxSum, currSum)

        # Since the problem requires average, we return the average
        return maxSum / k
