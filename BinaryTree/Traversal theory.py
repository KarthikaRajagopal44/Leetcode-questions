# Preorder Traversal (Root, Left, Right):
# Preorder traversal visits nodes in the following order: Root, Left, Right.

# Algorithmic Steps:

# Visit the Root node.
# Recursively traverse the Left subtree.
# Recursively traverse the Right subtree.
# Steps:

# Visit Root.
# If Left child exists, go to the Left child and repeat the process.
# If Right child exists, go to the Right child and repeat the process.
# Inorder Traversal (Left, Root, Right):
# Inorder traversal visits nodes in the following order: Left, Root, Right.

# Algorithmic Steps:

# Recursively traverse the Left subtree.
# Visit the Root node.
# Recursively traverse the Right subtree.
# Steps:

# If Left child exists, go to the Left child and repeat the process.
# Visit Root.
# If Right child exists, go to the Right child and repeat the process.
# Postorder Traversal (Left, Right, Root):
# Postorder traversal visits nodes in the following order: Left, Right, Root.

# Algorithmic Steps:

# Recursively traverse the Left subtree.
# Recursively traverse the Right subtree.
# Visit the Root node.
# Steps:

# If Left child exists, go to the Left child and repeat the process.
# If Right child exists, go to the Right child and repeat the process.
# Visit Root.
# These steps can be implemented recursively in code, as seen in the examples I provided earlier, or iteratively using stacks. The choice of traversal depends on the specific problem youâ€™re trying to solve, such as searching, sorting, or modifying the tree.
